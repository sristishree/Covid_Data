# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on state-wise Covid Data

I have performed basic EDA on a Covid dataset containing state-wise data.
<p> The dataset has been taken from <strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/anandhuh/latest-covid19-india-statewise-data">here</a></strong> </p>

### Basic Overview of the dataset:
Total number of cases | Active cases | Discharged cases | Number of deaths | Active ratio | Discharge ratio | Death ratio  

### Libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandasql

Feel free to discuss your ideas about ways to generate analysis and insights from this or any dataset in general.
